# Python Beginner Level Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises which I did to learn Python programming as a beginner and practise coding skills on GitHub. The exercises cover various fundamental concepts of Python, including data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, and more. Each exercise is carefully crafted to provide hands-on practice and reinforce understanding of Python concepts through practical coding exercises.
